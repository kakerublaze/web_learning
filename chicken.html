<h1>Chicken</h1>

<p>
    The <b>chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus)</b> is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus), originally
    native to Southeast Asia. It was first domesticated around 8,000 years ago and has become one of the most common and
    widespread domesticated animals in the world. Chickens are primarily kept for their meat and eggs, though they are also
    kept as pets.[1]
</p>

<p>
    As of 2023, the global chicken population exceeds 26.5 billion, with more than 50 billion birds produced annually for
    consumption. Specialized breeds such as broilers and laying hens have been developed for meat and egg production,
    respectively. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. Chickens are social animals with complex
    vocalizations and behaviors, and feature prominently in folklore, religion, and literature across many societies. Their
    economic importance makes them a central component of global animal husbandry and agriculture.

<h2>Nomenclature</h2>
<p>Chicken can mean a chick, and this was historically the meaning of the word chicken,[16] as in William Shakespeare's
play Macbeth, where Macduff laments the death of "all my pretty chickens and their dam".[17] The usage is preserved in
placenames such as the Hen and Chicken Islands.[18] In older sources, and still often in trade and scientific contexts,
chickens as a species are described as common fowl or domestic fowl.[19]</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most breeds, and the
wings are short.[20] Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow them to fly more
than a short distance.[21] Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[20] Newly-hatched chicks of both modern and
heritage varieties weigh the same, about 37 g (1.3 oz). Modern varieties however grow much faster; by day 35 a Ross 708
broiler may weigh 1.8 kg (4.0 lb) as against the 1.05 kg (2.3 lb) of a heritage chicken of the same age.[22]</p>

<p>Adult chickens of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on
either side under their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in males. Some breeds have a mutation
that causes extra feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.[23]</p>

<p>Chickens are omnivores.[24] In the wild, they scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and animals as large as
lizards, small snakes,[25] and young mice.[26] A chicken may live for 5–10 years, depending on the breed.[27] The
world's oldest known chicken lived for 16 years.[28]</p>


<h2>Reproduction and life-cycle</h2>
<p>To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen (a circle dance), often lowering the wing
which is closest to the hen.[36] The dance triggers a response in the hen[36] and when she responds to his call, the
rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating. Mating typically involves a sequence in which the male approaches
the female and performs a waltzing display. If the female is unreceptive, she runs off; otherwise, she crouches, and the
male mounts, treading with both feet on her back. After copulation the male does a tail-bending display.[37]</p>

<p>Sperm transfer occurs by cloacal contact between the male and female, in an action called the 'cloacal kiss'.[38] As
with all birds, reproduction is controlled by a neuroendocrine system,[39] the Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone-I neurons
in the hypothalamus. Reproductive hormones including estrogen, progesterone, and gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone and
follicle-stimulating hormone) initiate and maintain sexual maturation changes. Reproduction declines with age, thought
to be due to a decline in GnRH-I-N.[40]</p>

<h2>Origin</h2>

<h3>Phylogeny</h3>
<p>Water or ground-dwelling fowl similar to modern partridges, in the Galliformes, the order of bird that chickens belong
to, survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that killed all tree-dwelling birds and their dinosaur
relatives.[48] Chickens are descended primarily from the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and are scientifically
classified as the same species.[49] Domesticated chickens freely interbreed with populations of red junglefowl.[49] The
domestic chicken has subsequently hybridised with grey junglefowl, Sri Lankan junglefowl and green junglefowl;[50] a
gene for yellow skin, for instance, was incorporated into domestic birds from the grey junglefowl (G. sonneratii).[51]
It is estimated that chickens share between 71 and 79% of their genome with red junglefowl.[50]</p>

<h3>Domestication</h3>
<p>According to one early study, a single domestication event of the red junglefowl in present-day Thailand gave rise to
the modern chicken with minor transitions separating the modern breeds.[54] The red junglefowl is well adapted to take
advantage of the vast quantities of seed produced during the end of the multi-decade bamboo seeding cycle, to boost its
own reproduction.[55] In domesticating the chicken, humans took advantage of the red junglefowl's ability to reproduce
prolifically when exposed to a surge in its food supply.[56]</p>

<p>Exactly when and where the chicken was domesticated remains controversial. Genomic studies estimate that the chicken was
domesticated 8,000 years ago[50] in Southeast Asia and spread to China and India 2,000 to 3,000 years later.
Archaeological evidence supports domestic chickens in Southeast Asia well before 6000 BC, China by 6000 BC and India by
2000 BC.[50][57][58] A landmark 2020 Nature study that fully sequenced 863 chickens across the world suggests that all
domestic chickens originate from a single domestication event of red junglefowl whose present-day distribution is
predominantly in southwestern China, northern Thailand and Myanmar. These domesticated chickens spread across Southeast
and South Asia where they interbred with local wild species of junglefowl, forming genetically and geographically
distinct groups. Analysis of the most popular commercial breed shows that the White Leghorn breed possesses a mosaic of
divergent ancestries inherited from subspecies of red junglefowl.[59][60][61]</p>
