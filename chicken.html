<h1>Chicken</h1>

<p>
    The <b>chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus)</b> is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus), originally
    native to Southeast Asia. It was first domesticated around 8,000 years ago and has become one of the most common and
    widespread domesticated animals in the world. Chickens are primarily kept for their meat and eggs, though they are also
    kept as pets.[1]
